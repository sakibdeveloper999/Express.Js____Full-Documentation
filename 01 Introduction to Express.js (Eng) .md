# 🚀 ** Introduction to Express.js**

---

## 🧩 **1. What is Express.js?**

**Express.js** is a **backend web application framework** built on top of **Node.js**.
It provides a simpler way to **create servers, handle routes, manage requests and responses, and build RESTful APIs** efficiently.

Think of **Node.js** as the engine, and **Express.js** as the car body — Express gives structure and tools to run the backend easily.

It is often called:

> “The de facto standard server framework for Node.js.”

---

## ⚙️ **2. Why We Need Express.js**

Before Express.js, working directly with **Node.js HTTP module** was complicated.
You had to manually write code to handle routes, parse data, manage errors, etc.
Express.js simplifies all that by providing:

* A **routing system**
* **Middleware support**
* **Error handling**
* **Template engine support**
* **REST API creation tools**

So, instead of spending time on setup, you can focus on logic.

## 🏗️ **3. Core Features of Express.js**

| Feature                 | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧭 **Routing**          | Built-in router to define multiple endpoints for your web app or API.                           |
| 🧱 **Middleware**       | Functions that process requests and responses — for authentication, logging, data parsing, etc. |
| ⚙️ **HTTP Methods**     | Easily handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.                                               |
| 🧾 **Template Engines** | Supports EJS, Pug, Handlebars to create dynamic HTML pages.                                     |
| 🌐 **Static Files**     | Serve images, CSS, JS directly using `express.static()`.                                        |
| 🧩 **REST API Support** | Build APIs that send and receive JSON effortlessly.                                             |
| ⚡ **Performance**       | Non-blocking I/O model from Node.js = fast and scalable.                                        |

## 🧠 **4. How Express.js Works (Flow)**

When a client (like a browser or frontend app) sends a request to the server:

1. **Request comes in** (GET/POST/etc.)
2. **Express middleware** processes the request (authentication, logging, validation)
3. **Route handler** decides what to do with the request
4. **Response is sent** back to the client (HTML page, JSON data, file, etc.)

**Diagram Example:**

```
[ Client ] → [ Express Server ]
     ↓
 Middleware (auth, body-parser, etc.)
     ↓
 Route Handler (GET / POST / PUT)
     ↓
[ Response sent to client ]
```

---

## 🧰 **5. Basic Example: “Hello World” App**

```js
// Step 1: Import Express
const express = require('express');

// Step 2: Create an app
const app = express();

// Step 3: Create a route
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World! This is Express.js Server.');
});

// Step 4: Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```

👉 Run this using:

```bash
node app.js
```

Then visit **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.

---

## 🔁 **6. Middleware in Express.js**

**Middleware** are functions that run between the request and response.
They can:

* Log details
* Parse data
* Check authentication
* Handle errors

Example:

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request received:', req.method, req.url);
  next(); // pass to the next middleware or route
});
```

---

## 🌐 **7. Routing in Express.js**

Routing defines **how the server responds** to different URL paths.

Example:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Home Page'));
app.get('/about', (req, res) => res.send('About Page'));
app.post('/login', (req, res) => res.send('Login Successful'));
```

Express makes routing **clean, readable, and modular**.

---

## 📦 **8. Serving Static Files**

You can serve images, CSS, and JS files easily using:

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

Now, any file inside the `public` folder is directly accessible from the browser.

---

## 💡 **9. Working with JSON and APIs**

To handle JSON data:

```js
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.body);
  res.json({ message: 'Data received successfully' });
});
```

This is what makes Express.js perfect for **RESTful API development**.

---

## ⚙️ **10. Template Engines**

Express supports template engines like **EJS**, **Pug**, and **Handlebars** to build dynamic web pages.

Example (EJS):

```js
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
  res.render('profile', { name: 'Sakib', age: 21 });
});
```

---

## 🧩 **11. Express.js Directory Structure (Example)**

```
my-express-app/
│
├── app.js
├── package.json
├── routes/
│   ├── userRoutes.js
│   └── productRoutes.js
├── public/
│   ├── style.css
│   └── script.js
├── views/
│   └── index.ejs
└── middleware/
    └── auth.js
```

This structure keeps code organized and scalable.

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ Not strongly opinionated   | You must decide folder structure and design patterns.            |
| ⚙️ Callbacks can get complex | Without async/await or promises, code can be messy.              |
| 🧩 Limited built-in tools    | Some features (like validation, ORM) require external libraries. |
